# Weather Web Application
This web application uses the openweathermap API to get the current weather of your location. There is also an input field where you can enter a city name and look at the weather at that city.
This application was created using HTML/CSS and Javascript. This project is hosted on github pages. https://justinwin13.github.io/weather-app/
